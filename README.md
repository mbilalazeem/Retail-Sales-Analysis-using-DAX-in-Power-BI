# Retail Sales Analysis using DAX in Power BI

## Project Overview
This project uses Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) in Power BI to conduct a detailed sales analysis on a fictitious retail demo dataset. It features various calculated columns and measures, such as profit, sales count, and profit margin ratio. The project also delves deep into sales by category and year, and investigates year-on-year change in sales.

## Key Features
- **Calculated Columns and Measures**: Leveraged DAX to create several calculated columns and measures like profit, sales count, and profit margin ratio, enabling in-depth analysis.
- **Sales by Category and Year**: Detailed analysis of sales performance by category and year, providing valuable insights into category performance over time.
- **Year-On-Year Change Analysis**: Computed year-on-year sales changes to understand the growth patterns and trends.
- **Date and Calculated Tables**: Developed a date table and other calculated tables using DAX for in-depth temporal analysis and effective data organization.

## Technical Aspects
This project involves extensive use of DAX in Power BI to create calculated columns and measures, computed tables, and perform detailed sales analysis.

## Tools Used
- Power BI: Used for data loading, DAX computations, data transformation, and visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a fictitious retail demo dataset often used for demonstrating Microsoft Business Intelligence products.

## Future Updates
- Extend the project to incorporate predictive analytics for sales and profit forecasting.
- Introduce further granularity in the analysis by exploring sales by individual products within categories.
